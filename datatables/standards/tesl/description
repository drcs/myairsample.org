Texas Effects Screening Levels

<http://www.tceq.texas.gov/toxicology/esl>

These levels are based on existing studies of chemical health
effects. Below these levels, no adverse health effects are
thought likely to occur. They reflect the
experimentally-determined levels at which the chemicals caused
adverse effects in study populations (NOAELs or LOAELs) of people
or animals, combined with safety factors to account for the
differences among human populations and between humans and
animals.

"Short-term" refers to an exposure duration of one hour. "Long-term"
refers to a duration of one year.

These levels reflect both cancer and non-cancer effects. They are not
legally enforceable.
