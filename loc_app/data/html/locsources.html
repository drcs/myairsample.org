<p>
Some government agencies have developed standards and screening levels
for toxic chemicals in the air based on health information about the
chemicals.  These agencies are listed below, with a brief description
of the methods used in establishing their levels.  Click on the agency
name to go to the source of the levels.

EPA Region 6 Screening Levels</a></font>
	
<p>These levels are based on existing studies of chemical health
  effects.  They levels are calculated for residential (as opposed to
  workplace) exposures.  They reflect the <i>risks</i> of exposure to
  a certain level of the chemical.  The levels listed as screening
  levels correspond to pre-determined levels of risk from exposure:
  either 1 in a million cancer risk or a "hazard quotient" of 1 for
  non-cancer effects, whichever corresponds to a lower concentration.
  These screening levels are not legally enforceable.

Texas Effects Screening Levels</a></font>
<p>These levels are based on existing studies of chemical health
  effects.  Below these levels, no adverse health effects are thought
  likely to occur.  They reflect the experimentally-determined levels
  at which the chemicals caused adverse effects in study populations
  (NOAELs or LOAELs) of people or animals, combined with safety
  factors to account for the differences among human populations and
  between humans and animals.<p>  "Short-term" refers to an exposure
  duration of one hour. "Long-term" refers in most cases to a duration
  of one year; for benzene and ethylene dichloride, it indicates a
  24-hour period.<p>  These levels reflect both cancer and non-cancer
  effects.  They are not legally enforceable.

Louisiana Ambient Air Quality Standards</a></font>
<p>These levels are legally enforceable standards in Louisiana,
  developed through Louisiana's regulatory process.  They are found
  in <b>Table 51.2</b> of Title 33, Part III.<p>  They are based on
  health effects information about the chemicals: the eight-hour
  standard modifies occupational exposure levels to be appropriate for
  residential exposures; the annual standard is based on EPA
  procedures for calculating cancer risks.

North Carolina Ambient Air Standards</a></font>
<p>These levels are legally enforceable standards in North Carolina,
  developed through North Carolina's regulatory process.<p>
  They are based on health effects information about the chemicals.

<a href="http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/mrls/index.asp">
ATSDR (American Toxic Substance and Disease Registry) Minimal Risk Levels </a></font>
<p>These levels are based on existing studies of chemical health
  effects.  Exposure at these levels is said to pose "minimal risks"
  of adverse health effects.  The levels were derived from the
  experimentally-determined levels at which the chemicals caused
  adverse effects in study populations (NOAELs or LOAELs) of people or
  animals, combined with uncertainty factors to account for the
  differences among human populations and between humans and
  animals.<p>  "Acute" exposure is defined as up to two weeks,
  "Intermediate" as between two weeks and one year, and "Chronic" as
  longer than a year.<p>  These levels reflect only non-cancer health
  effects.  They are not legally enforceable.
