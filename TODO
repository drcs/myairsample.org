To do list for Greg on myairsample-alpha – 6/22/2013

Tabbing within Chemical name and Measured value should go left to right and then down to the next 
chemical name

Tabbing should not tab to blue question marks or add more chemical option

If possible, implement a warning that a chemical is not in the database or is misspelled here, 
once they tab or move out of a chemical name box – have that warning come up in red text 
with three exclamation points at the beginning and end of the warning.


+ templatize the html report
+ standards.py: clean up whitespace in datatables
+ implement links in PDF documents (and markdown_ltx)
