To do list for Greg on myairsample-alpha – 6/22/2013

If possible, implement a warning that a chemical is not in the database or is misspelled here, 
once they tab or move out of a chemical name box – have that warning come up in red text 
with three exclamation points at the beginning and end of the warning.


+ templatize the html report
+ standards.py: clean up whitespace in datatables
+ implement links in PDF documents (and markdown_ltx)
