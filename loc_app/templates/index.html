	    Enter chemicals of interest and their measured levels.  If you are
	    working from bucket results, enter the chemicals for which there was a
	    measurable concentration (instead of ND or nondetect).  You should be
	    able to use common synonyms for the chemicals, but abbreviations might
	    need to be spelled out.  Be sure that all of the values you enter are
	    in the units that you select for "Units your measured values are in

	  </p>
	  <p>
	    For example, bucket results are in both &micro;g/m<sup>3</sup> and ppbv. If there are
	    TICs (tentatively identified compounds), those are reported in
	    &micro;g/m<sup>3</sup>. It makes sense, then, to choose &micro;g/m<sup>3</sup> if you are using bucket
	    results.  For more information about what units are, click <a class="help" href="#help_units_definition">here</a>.

	    What you choose here will determine whether the numbers in the report
	    will be expressed in ppb, &micro;g/m<sup>3</sup>, or ppbv. For example, if you choose
	    ppb, you will see both your monitoring results and the levels of
	    concern in terms of ppb. You should choose whatever units you are most
	    comfortable with as the units for your final report.  For more
	    information about what units are, click <a class="help" href="#help_units_definition">here</a>.

	    Parts per billion (ppb) describes how many weighed parts of a chemical there
	    are for 1 billion parts of air. For example, a recipe says to add just a drop of
	    vanilla for every 100 pounds of flour. The drop of vanilla weighs hardly
	    anything, but it has a big effect on the cookies' flavor. Similarly, if we measure
	    benzene in the air, we might find 3 "drops" of benzene for 1,000,000,000
	    (one billion) "drops" of air. It seems like a small amount, but it is significant.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Parts per billion by volume, or ppbv, means the concentration has been figured
	    out in terms of how much space the molecules take up. For example, if we
	    make a mixture of 3 cups of vanilla and 1 billion cups of flour, then our
	    concentration is 3 parts volume (cups of vanilla) per billion parts volume (cups
	    of flour), or 3 ppbv sugar in flour. When 3 volumes of benzene are in a billion
	    volumes of air, the concentration is 3 ppbv benzene in air.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Micrograms per meters cubed (&micro;g/m<sup>3</sup>) describes how much of a chemical's
	    weight is in a volume of air that takes up one cubic meter. Imagine an empty
	    box that is three feet long on both sides, and three feet tall. One meter is about
	    three feet long. So the box's volume is 1 cubic meter, or 1 m<sup>3</sup>. A microgram
	    (&micro;g) is a very small weight, like that of a grain of sand. You put 3 grains of sand
	    into the box. The concentration of sand inside the box is the weight of the sand
	    (3 &micro;g) divided by the
	    volume of the box (1 m<sup>3</sup>), or 3 &micro;g /m<sup>3</sup>. Like grains of sand, chemicals can also be
	    reported by weight and volume. For example, a monitor might read 5 &micro;g /m<sup>3</sup>
	    benzene, or 5 &micro;g of benzene in 1 m<sup>3</sup> of air.

	    You can enter a name for the sample here.  If you are working with
	    bucket results, the air collected in one bucket on one date is the
	    sample.  You might have a name you want to use for this bucket sample
	    or you might not.  It is optional to enter a sample identifying name.
	    If entered, the sample identifying name will appear on the first page
	    of the report.  Examples of possible sample identifying names include
	    "Sample from Ms. Jones' house" and "RAN project sample 1" – these
	    would return on the report as "Sample identifying name: Sample from
	    Ms.  Jones' house" and "Sample identifying name: RAN project sample 1".

	<div id="help_sample_date">

	    the date the sample was taken would be the date the bucket was used to collect the air at the 
	    sample location.  You can also enter a time here, and you can enter the date and/or time in 
	    any format you want.  Examples of possible entries here include "6/22/2013", "June 22, 2013 
	    5pm", "6:42 pm on 6-22-2013", and "summertime" – these would return on the report as "Date

	<div id="help_sample_location">
	  <p>
	    Here you can enter the location where the sample was taken.  If you
	    are working with bucket results, this would be the address or some
	    other name for the location where the bucket was put to collect the
	    air sample.  It is optional to enter a location for the sample.  If
	    entered, the location will appear on the first page of the report.
	    For example, if you enter "1200 Main Street" it will appear on the
	    report as "Location sample was taken at: 1200 Main Street" and if you
	    enter "My house" it will appear as "Location sample was taken at: my

	Taking samples with buckets can get your community valuable
	information about what's in the air that you're breathing.  But how do
	you know what the levels of chemicals in your air mean to your health?
      </p>
      <p>
	One way of interpreting monitoring results – from either bucket
	samples or monitoring done by agencies – is to compare them to what we
	call "levels of concern."  The "levels of concern" in this tool
	include legally enforceable "standards" designated by state
	governments, as well as "screening levels" or "minimum risk levels"
	that are not legally enforceable but are developed by government
	agencies from scientific studies about what levels of chemical
	exposure pose minimal risk to your health.
      </p>
      <p>
	This tool looks up levels of concern for chemicals that you are
	interested in and compares them to results you have from monitoring.
	The report it generates tells you whether any of the levels of
	chemicals in your air are above the levels of concern you choose to
	compare to.
