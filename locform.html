Taking samples with buckets can get your community valuable information about what's in the air that you're breathing.
But how do you know what the levels of chemicals in your air mean to your health?
<p>  
One way of interpreting monitoring results--from either bucket samples or monitoring done by agencies--is to compare them
to what we call "levels of concern."  </b><br>
<table border=0 cellpadding=10 width=90% align=center><tr><td>
<font size=+1>
Some levels of concern are levels that state governments have designated as the maximum levels of toxics
that are allowed to be in the air.  These levels are called "standards" and are legally enforceable in 
states that have them.  <p>
Other levels of concern are developed by government agencies which survey scientific studies to figure out
what levels of chemical exposure pose minimal risk to your health.  The agencies consider these levels 
(called "screening levels" or "minimum risk levels") as something like a borderline between levels of chemical exposure
that <i>could</i> do you harm and levels that <i>probably won't</i> do you any harm.  They are not legally enforceable.

This page looks up Levels of Concern for chemicals that you are interested in and compares them to
results you have from monitoring.  The report it generates tells you whether any of the levels of chemicals in
your air are above the levels of concern.
<p>
Remember: Levels of Concern are only part of the story.  There are limitations to what is known about the 
health effects of chemicals.  There may be health impacts associated even with levels of chemicals 
below the levels of concern. </b>

3. Choose your units.</i></b></font>

<br>What you choose here will determine whether the numbers in the report will be expressed in ppb, ug/m3, or ppbv.
For example, if you choose ppb, you will see both your monitoring results <i>and</i> the levels of concern in
terms of ppb.  You should <b>choose whatever units you are most comfortable with</b> as the units for your final report.
<p><br>
<table border=0 width=100%><tr><td>
<font size=+1><b>What units are your measured values (input) in?  </b></font></td>
<td><select name="inunits"><option>ppb<option>ppbv<option selected>ug/m3</select></td></tr></table>
<br>Here you should choose the units that the results from your monitoring were reported in.  Choose only
one type of units for all of the chemicals and values that you will enter in the table below.  <br>
For example, bucket results are in both ug/m3 and ppbv.  If there are TICs (tentatively identified compounds), 
those are reported in ug/m3.  It makes sense, then, to <b>choose ug/m3 if you are using bucket results</b>.
</td>
<td  bgcolor="#CCFFCC" valign=top><b><i><center>What are "units"?</center></i></b>
<p>
<font size=-1>Units give meaning to the numbers we use to describe quantities.<p>
For instance, if someone asked you how long something was, you might say 12 inches or 1 foot or 30 centimeters.
"<b>Inches</b>," "<b>feet</b>," and "<b>centimeters</b>" are all <b><i>units</i></b> that we use to measure length.
Those three answers all mean the same thing even though they are different numbers (12, 1, and 30) because they use 
different units of measurement.
<p>
When we talk about levels of chemicals in the air, we are talking about <b><i>concentrations</i></b>.  While
length is measured in inches and centimeters, concentrations are commonly measured in <b>Parts per Billion (ppb)</b>,
or <b>Micrograms per Meters Cubed (ug/m3)</b>.
<p>
<b>Parts per billion (ppb)</b> describes how many parts of a chemical are in the same space as 1 billion 
parts of air.  So 3ppb means there are 3 parts chemical for every 1,000,000,000 parts of air.</font>
<br><font size=-2>Usually ppb are figured out in terms of the weight of chemical and air molecules.  
But where you see <b>ppb <i> by volume</i></b> or <b>ppbv</b>, that means the concentration has been 
figured out in terms of volume, or how much space the molecules take up.  This is a less common meaning 
of parts per billion.</font>
<p>
<font size=-1>
<b>Micrograms per Meters Cubed (ug/m3)</b> describes how much of a chemical--by weight--is in a volume of air that
takes up one cubic meter.  Imagine a box filled with air that measures one meter on every side.  If there were 3 micrograms,
or 3 millionths of 1 gram, of chemical in that box, then the concentration would be 3ug/m3.

<br>If you are working from bucket results, enter the chemicals for which there was a measurable
concentration (instead of ND).<br>  You should be able to use common synonyms for the chemicals.  <br>
Be sure that all of the values you enter are in the units that you selected for "measured values" or "input" above.
