	The EPA-approved "bucket" is a simple, easy-to-use tool that
	fenceline neighbors of oil refineries, factories, and other industrial
	sites can use to take air samples.  The data produced from these
	samples is just as good as monitoring data from the EPA or LDEQ and
	captures emissions from within the communities most affected.  This is
	a powerful experience for community members who are used to being
	ignored, overlooked and disrespected by corporations and government.
      </p>
      <p>      
	Dorothy Jenkins, President of Concerned Citizens of New Sarpy, used to
	call the refinery to complain about odors.  An operator would tell her
	not to worry, that the black plume of smoke billowing for hours near
	her home was not harmful.  Then, Jenkins got an air sample bucket.
	Now, when refinery managers and government regulators tell her there
	is nothing to worry about, she answers: <i>"Why, then, was there a
	benzene reading of 14 in my air sample - a reading that violates the
	state standards?"</i> The bucket, coupled with participatory training on
	the chemicals emitted at refineries, as well as state and federal
	regulations for those emissions, gives community members power to hold
	institutions accountable to provide a safe and healthy environment.
      </p>
      <p>      
	The Louisiana Bucket Brigade and other bucket brigades across the
	country train community members to conduct hot spot monitoring with
	the bucket.  They monitor when there is a visible problem in the
	neighborhood, when they fear they are most at risk of chemical
	exposure.
      </p>

	Some communities might also have access to air monitoring data
	taken using other equipment such as Summa cannisters.  You can learn
	more about this and other kinds of air monitoring at
