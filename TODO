Clicking in a chemical name or measured value box below the first one
doesn't "stick" – it moves the cursor up to the first box

Next to the boxes for Organization name 1, Organization name 2, Sample
identifying name, Date sample was taken, and Location sample was taken
at add this in a black text that's the size of the Select font:
(optional)
 

Put the ending periods in the blue question mark text inside the quote
mark (i.e. for Chemical name/Measured value help text, Sample
identifying name help text, and Location sample was taken at help
text)

Change the first line of the first paragraph on the right to: "Taking
air samples can get your community valuable information...."

Change the first line of the second paragraph on the right to: "One
way of interpreting monitoring results – from either bucket samples or
other kinds of samples – is to..."
 

The # sign entered in various boxes returns gobbledygook

-fix it so that the # sign can be entered

-are there other symbols that return gobbledygook that need to be fixed?

-make it so that if the system fails, you first get a professional message?  Perhaps it could be:

Whoops!  Something went wrong in our system.  Click here for technical
information about what went wrong.  If you have time, it would be
helpful to us if you copied and pasted the technical information about
what went wrong into an email and sent it to drcsdirector@gmail.com

 

0.000012 is returning at 1.2 e -5 in the pdf report – fix that so
there is either no limit or a much ridiculously higher limit ... like
10 or 20 zeros
 

In the box where you choose the one set of levels, have those listed in alphabetical order


Would it be possible for the warning to be on a single line spanning
the chemical name and measured value box?
 

Make a new number 4 between #3 and #4, and make #4 into number 5

For the new number 4:

4. Choose text options for the end of the report (blue question mark here)

¦an explanation of both units and levels of concern

¦an explanation of units only

¦an explanation of levels of concern only

¦no text at the end of the report

And make it functional

 

Make two new alpha site designs for me to look at:

-myairsample-alpha-2.dreamhosters.com

-myairsample-alpha-3.dreamhosters.com

Have them both be vertical designs for the report part

Have #2 have the entry boxes in a vertical column on the left, and the pop-up help text in a column in the middle of the page

Have #2 have the pop-up help in a vertical column on the left, and the entry boxes in a column in the middle



+ "chemical not found" warning: don't mess up input alignment;
  warning appear on one line that spans both columns
+ templatize the html report
+ standards.py: clean up whitespace in datatables
+ implement links in PDF documents (and markdown_ltx)
