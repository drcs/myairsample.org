ATSDR (American Toxic Substance and Disease Registry) Minimal Risk Levels

<http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/mrls/index.asp>

These levels are based on existing studies of chemical health
effects. Exposure at these levels is said to pose "minimal risks"
of adverse health effects. The levels were derived from the
experimentally-determined levels at which the chemicals caused
adverse effects in study populations (NOAELs or LOAELs) of people
or animals, combined with uncertainty factors to account for the
differences among human populations and between humans and
animals.

"Acute" exposure is defined as up to two weeks, "Intermediate" as
between two weeks and one year, and "Chronic" as longer than a year.

These levels reflect only non-cancer health effects. They are not
legally enforceable.
