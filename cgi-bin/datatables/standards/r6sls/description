EPA Region 6 Screening Levels

<http://www.epa.gov/earth1r6/6pd/rcra/pd-n/screen.htm>

These levels are based on existing studies of chemical health effects.
They levels are calculated for residential (as opposed to workplace)
exposures. They reflect the risks of exposure to a certain level of the
chemical. The levels listed as screening levels correspond to pre-
determined levels of risk from exposure: either 1 in a million cancer risk
or a "hazard quotient" of 1 for non-cancer effects, whichever
corresponds to a lower concentration. These screening levels are not
legally enforceable.
