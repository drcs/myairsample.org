Make boxes around blue question marks smaller; they should just
enclose the question mark, and not go into other text or boxes'
territory

Would it be possible for the warning to be on a single line spanning
the chemical name and measured value box?  (This is lower priority
than other fixes, so if it's difficult to implement, do this one last)


+ "chemical not found" warning: don't mess up input alignment
+ templatize the html report
+ standards.py: clean up whitespace in datatables
+ implement links in PDF documents (and markdown_ltx)
