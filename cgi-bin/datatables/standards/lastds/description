Louisiana Ambient Air Quality Standards

http://www.deq.louisiana.gov/portal/tabid/1674/Default.aspx

These levels are legally enforceable standards in Louisiana, developed
through Louisiana's regulatory process. They are found in Table 51.2 of
Title 33, Part III.
They are based on health effects information about the chemicals: the
eight-hour standard modifies occupational exposure levels to be
appropriate for residential exposures; the annual standard is based on
EPA procedures for calculating cancer risks.
