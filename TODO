PDF report isn't working right:

-if sample identifying name, date sample was taken and/or location
 sample was taken at is left blank, then those should not appear in
 the report at all; right now, these titles are showing in the report
 when left blank

Make boxes around blue question marks smaller; they should just
enclose the question mark, and not go into other text or boxes'
territory

 

Make the blue text a much darker blue

Make the blue question marks and boxes a sky blue

Add periods to blue text where I didn't have ending periods.

Make LABB logo size smaller

Make "An online tool to compare air sampling results to pollutant
levels of concern" smaller font

Make DRCS logo a little bigger to be same size as a smaller LABB logo

Make the LABB logo a link to LABB's web site

Make DRCS logo a link to our GitHub page

Even more space between the two logos

Line break for Units text should be as follows:

Units your measured
values are in (input)

&

Units you would like
your report in (output)

And these two items need much more space between them

Chemical name and Measured value boxes need much less space between
them – like switch it so that Units items have the space that Chemical
name and Measured value have between them, and make Chemical name and
Measured value have just a little bit more space than the units items
currently have between them
 
Longer boxes for Sample identifying name, Date sample was taken and
Location sample was taken at

Smaller font size for "Select"s

Less space between report entry boxes and the vertical green line/paragraph

Have the green links not exactly centered – move them left more, but
not completely justified left

Replace standards in the #3 like so:

"Compare your air data to these levels of concern:"

"one set of levels"

"all levels your sample is above"

"all available levels of concern"
 

Replace "FAQs" with "About bucket samples and monitoring"

Tab to the units before tabbing to the report title

Have it say "add more chemicals" not just "add chemicals"

Remove the three exclamation points from the front and back of the
warning – just red text

Would it be possible for the warning to be on a single line spanning
the chemical name and measured value box?  (This is lower priority
than other fixes, so if it's difficult to implement, do this one last)

Green box above MyAirSample.org title, a little thicker than the other
green lines
 

Put this in for the paragraph on the right:

Taking samples with buckets can get your community valuable
information about what's in the air that you're breathing.  But how do
you know what the levels of chemicals in your air mean to your health?

One way of interpreting monitoring results – from either bucket
samples or monitoring done by agencies – is to compare them to what we
call "levels of concern."  The "levels of concern" in this tool
include legally enforceable "standards" designated by state
governments, as well as "screening levels" or "minimum risk levels"
that are not legally enforceable but are developed by government
agencies from scientific studies about what levels of chemical
exposure pose minimal risk to your health.

This tool looks up levels of concern for chemicals that you are
interested in and compares them to results you have from monitoring.
The report it generates tells you whether any of the levels of
chemicals in your air are above the levels of concern you choose to
compare to.

 

Blue help text to add in:

 

Units your measured values are in (input)

Here you should choose the units that the results from your monitoring
were reported in. Choose only one type of units for all of the
chemicals and values that you enter in the table to the left.

For example, bucket results are in both µg/m3 and ppbv. If there are
TICs (tentatively identified compounds), those are reported in
µg/m3. It makes sense, then, to choose µg/m3 if you are using bucket
results.  For more information about what units are, click here.

When the user clicks here, replace the above with the Units
information blurb from the pdf report.

Units you would like your report in (output)

What you choose here will determine whether the numbers in the report
will be expressed in ppb, µg/m3, or ppbv. For example, if you choose
ppb, you will see both your monitoring results and the levels of
concern in terms of ppb. You should choose whatever units you are most
comfortable with as the units for your final report.  For more
information about what units are, click here.

When the user clicks here, replace the above with the Units
information blurb from the pdf report.




+ "chemical not found" warning: don't mess up input alignment
+ templatize the html report
+ standards.py: clean up whitespace in datatables
+ implement links in PDF documents (and markdown_ltx)
