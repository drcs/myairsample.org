Make boxes around blue question marks smaller; they should just
enclose the question mark, and not go into other text or boxes'
territory

Make the blue text a much darker blue

Make the blue question marks and boxes a sky blue

Tab to the units before tabbing to the report title

Would it be possible for the warning to be on a single line spanning
the chemical name and measured value box?  (This is lower priority
than other fixes, so if it's difficult to implement, do this one last)

 

Blue help text to add in:

 

Units your measured values are in (input)

Here you should choose the units that the results from your monitoring
were reported in. Choose only one type of units for all of the
chemicals and values that you enter in the table to the left.

For example, bucket results are in both µg/m3 and ppbv. If there are
TICs (tentatively identified compounds), those are reported in
µg/m3. It makes sense, then, to choose µg/m3 if you are using bucket
results.  For more information about what units are, click here.

When the user clicks here, replace the above with the Units
information blurb from the pdf report.

Units you would like your report in (output)

What you choose here will determine whether the numbers in the report
will be expressed in ppb, µg/m3, or ppbv. For example, if you choose
ppb, you will see both your monitoring results and the levels of
concern in terms of ppb. You should choose whatever units you are most
comfortable with as the units for your final report.  For more
information about what units are, click here.

information blurb from the pdf report.




+ "chemical not found" warning: don't mess up input alignment
+ templatize the html report
+ standards.py: clean up whitespace in datatables
+ implement links in PDF documents (and markdown_ltx)
